# spotify-recommendation-Group-6

The purpose of this project was to build data visualizations using Spotify's API. Users of the website would input an artist they want recommendations for and a popularity level, then the artist's top 10 songs and 100 recommendations would be visualized on a variety of factors. This project would be accomplished through multiple steps.

First, data would be pulled Spotify's API and uploaded to an sqllite server. Data would then be read from the sqllite server and read through a Flask API to gather the data for the visualization website.


        Note: This solution to gather data is not the most efficient, as it would be simplier to run the app and data through python. However, as this project is a learning exercise, we wanted to utilize our knowledge of SQL databases.
